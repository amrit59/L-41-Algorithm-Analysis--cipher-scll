The speed of an algorithms depends on the different factors like ram,prog etc
We need a criteria by which we can say that the algorithm is better 
We will analyse algorithms based on the no. of lines of code executed, where we can take the example of the insertion sort(A)

INSERTION SORT(A)
for j= 2 to A.length
key=A[i]
// Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1.. j-1]
i=j-1
while i>0 and A[i] > key
A[i+1] = A[i]
A[i+1] = A[i]
i=i-1
A[i+1] = key.
